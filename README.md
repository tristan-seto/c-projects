Personal C/C++ Projects

This repository consists of side-projects I have worked on using the C/C++ languages during my time at the University of Toronto.
The projects in this repository are based on the knowledge I've acquired from the following courses:

• **APS 105 S** - Computer Fundamentals (Winter 2023), Language: C

• **ECE 244 F** – Programming Fundamentals (Fall 2023), Language: C++

This repository does not include any of my coursework from the above courses. Coursework that further demonstrates my ability in C/C++ can be made avaialble upon request.
